		      <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
		      <p>A personal trainer is an individual certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in exercise prescription and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and accountability to clients. Trainers also measure their client's strengths and weaknesses with fitness assessments. These fitness assessments may also be performed before and after an exercise program to measure their client's improvements in physical fitness. They should also educate their clients in many other aspects of wellness besides exercise, including general health and nutrition guidelines. It is very important that a trainer takes their time to evaluate a client's personal life outside of the gym.</p>

		      <h4>Diet Chart</h4>
		      <p>A low-calorie, high-nutrition diet that helps lose weight without compromising the person’s health is thus recommended,” says Bangalore-based nutritionist, Priyannka Aashu Singh, who is with Portea Medical, which is a home healthcare provider. <br>“There has been a lot of hue and cry about low carb diets. One must understand that although a low carbohydrate and a high-fat diet (Atkins diet) has been shown to cause weight loss of about 3.3 kg in six months, there has been no significant difference in the weight loss after 12 months when compared to low fat diets
